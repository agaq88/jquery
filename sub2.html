		<h2>Objectives</h2>

			<h3>Phase I - Developement</h3>
			<p>Will involve setting up the global consortium, advertising the ambitious objectives and securing the necessary sponsorship to initiate the project. </p>

			</div>

			<p> For an ambitious project of this kind to succeed it will require a dedicated group of multidisciplinary scientists from academia and industry with specialist expertise ranging from laboratory to field research. These world-leading scientists will require substantial funding to motivate and support their continued involvment in the SUB2 project. The make-up of the project consortium will be guided by this requirment and the need to develop state-of-the-art technologies and approaches. The major and unlimited prospects for commercial benefit will ensure the development of numerous small, medium and large enterprise partnerships with industry; cornserstone for the success of the SUB2 project. An estimate of $30million of funding will be sought over the next 5 years.</p>

			<h3>Phase II - Implementation</h3>

			<p>Aimed at establishing the project and achieving the 1:59:59 objective.</p>

			</div>

			<p>The level of success achieved during Phase 1 will dictate to a large extent whether all necessary requirements will have been attained for the successful implementation of the SUB2 project. While Phase 1 and 2 have separate aims, objectives and timeframes, these distinct phases will commence from the onset of the project. Cornerstone to the successful implementation of the project will be securing the engagement and full support of all necessary stakeholders including scientists and medical personnel, industry, sponsors, athletes, athlete management agencies and local, national and international sporting governing bodies.</p>

		<p>Analyzing, with the use of satellite and ground data, the environmental (mainly thermal) conditions of past marathon routes but most importantly by providing, real time information during the race on ambient thermal conditions.

		This task aims to contribute to the objectives of sub2hrs project by analyzing, with the use of satellite and ground data, the environmental (mainly thermal) conditions of past marathon routes but most importantly by providing, with the use of satellite data, real time information during the race on ambient thermal conditions which change considerably along the route and with time.  <br>

		<br>
		In particular during this task, a novel application will be developed with the use of satellite data, and in conjunction with ground based data, so as to facilitate the operational use of extracted information regarding land surface and air temperatures along a route at temporal and spatial resolutions as high as 15 minutes and 1 km x 1km respectively. In practical terms, through the above application a series of near real time snapshots of the thermal environment along the route will be provided as well as detailed knowledge of the thermal characteristics at points along the remaining part of the route. The application will also allow the development of tailor- made products (given such as the thermal comfort and effort indicators (based on information on the thermal environment, relative humidity, the slope and elevation along the route, the type of materials on the ground, etc.) <br>
		<br>
		For the purposes of sub2hrs project, the ground based infrastructure for the acquisition of satellite data of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) will be used; satellite data from several missions will be also exploited in an effort to expand the geographic coverage of the applications. During the task, fine tuning of the methodologies will be promoted especially with respect to the link of land surface to air temperature, validations on the basis of historic data from previous marathon races and finally the preparation of contingency plans to overcome the difficulty that cloudy skies result in the acquaintance of data for the thermal environment at the ground.<br>
		<br>
		Research work has been already initiated; in the following Figure, a representation (© IAASARS/NOA, 2015) is given regarding the prevailing land surface temperatures at specific points along the Marathon race in Beijing during the Olympic Games 2008. It should be mentioned that land surface temperature is an important parameter in the studies of urban thermal environment and dynamics. Land surface temperature modulates the air temperature of the lower layer of the atmosphere and is a primary factor in determining surface radiation and energy exchange, the internal climate in cities, and human comfort in the cities.<br>
		<br>
		Professor Constantinos Cartalis from the Department of Environmental Physics of the University of Athens (UOA), Greece and former Secretary General for the Olympic Games 2004 at the Hellenic Ministry of Culture, and Senior Researcher Dr. Iphigenia Keramitsoglou from the Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS) of the National Observatory of Athens, Greece, will act as co-chairs for this task. They both have experience in environmental and satellite-based technologies and applications, and  have undertaken research within the DRAGON programme of the European Space Agency, to assess the use of satellite data in support of major sporting events (with case studies being the Olympic Games of Athens and Beijing).</p>

		<h2>Anti-doping</h2>

		<h3>Serve as a model for future sporting success</h3>

		<p>The SUB2 project is a “3P” proof-of-concept idea motivated by the need to prevent doping (1P), protect the clean athlete (2P), and promote performance without doping (3P). The SUB2 project is a “clean running” project, with the aim to promote clean marathon running i.e. high performance marathon running without doping. As such, all athletes participating in the project will undergo regular doping controls (blood and urine); tests will be carried out, handled and analysed and the data interpreted in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA’s) Athlete Biological Passport Operating Guidelines. While there are no guarantees the SUB2 consortium will succeed in delivering a sub2hr marathon within 5 years, a successful SUB2 project could serve as a model for future sporting success.</p>

		</div>

		<p>The sub2hrs-project aims to show what humans can achieve when natural gifts and genuine dedication come together. True performances are achieved without the aid of prohibited medications and drugs. Current anti-doping regulations are strict and clear and will be followed stringently in the project. All participating athletes will be part of their national anti-doping programs and IAAF-regulations, just like their competitors. In order to prevent any doubts on the performances of the athletes involved, an anti-doping program will be established that complements and strengthens the existing frameworks.

		A holistic approach on anti-doping will be used that simultaneously focuses on preventing doping, protecting the clean athlete, and promoting peak performance without doping. Doping prevention will include extra education sessions targeted at both knowledge improvement and influencing attitudes of both athletes and their direct environment. Complementary to this, the clean athlete is protected by additional doping controls (blood and urine) beyond the regular programs. Samples will be stored to benefit from future advancements in detection methods. Tests will be carried out, handled and analysed and the data interpreted in accordance with WADA’s World Anti-Doping Program. All doping control results will be used to strengthen ongoing scientific research as well and thus assist with the development of the next generation anti-doping tests. By combining these aspects clean high performance marathon running will be promoted and these experiences will benefit all sports and athletes of future generations.</p>
